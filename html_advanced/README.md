You are not allowed to install, import or use external libraries. This website must be build with only HTML/CSS/JavaScript. No NodeJS, React, VueJS, Bootstrap, etc.
Your code should be W3C compliant and validate with W3C-Validator

In this and coming projects, you will implement from scratch a webpage from a designer file.

For this first project, you will focus on the HTML structure only - no CSS, no style - just pure HTML semantic.

This designer file will be available on Figma - feel free to create an account to access the final result here:
